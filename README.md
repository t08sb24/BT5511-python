Mutation Analysis and Prioritization for Therapeutic Development
This repository contains Python code for analyzing mutation screening data and generating visualizations to prioritize candidate genes based on their impact on mRNA and protein expression as well as cell viability. The analysis focuses on mutations in promoter regions, and the code implements robust data preprocessing, mutation classification, fold change calculations, and composite scoring.
